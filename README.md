# Hand-in-Unity

This project is based on Python and Unity. Its a fun project that you can "See" your own hand in a 3d form in Unity and move some object.

The hand tracking module used in the project is mediapipe which you can find all the documentation in https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html

Mediapipe is a lightweight hand tracking module which use trnserflow lite that can reach 20+ fps by only using CPU. Try it out and see how amazing it is.
